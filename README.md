# Women's comfort - BYTEEX Landing

This SPA is about comfortable things for women and customer feedback.

The project contains 12 sections where universal components with the possibility of reuse and expansion are used (SOLID). The position of these components is described by separate containers (BEM). Each interactive element has a 'hover' behavior and a set 'transition' to improve the user experience (UX).

There are two types of universal Sliders and Photos-tape, which listen to the 'resize' event and adjust to the actual size after debounce. The index.css file contains all the reset parameters and css constants.

Project architecture:
- api folder, to get constant values for each of the sections (replaces requests to the server);
- components folder
- images folder
- types folder (for complex or frequently used types);
- utils folder, with functions for calculations and custom hooks;

## Tecnologies:
[TypeScript, React, JS, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, OOP, SOLID, BEM, semantice, React-intersection-observer, React-collapse, React-countup–± screens adaptability].
